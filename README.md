Description:
Easy Currency Converter is a simple Python program designed to convert a specified amount of one currency to another. The application uses the ExchangeRate API to get currency codes and rates. The program can be used by anyone who needs to do currency conversions such as forex traders, cryptocurrency traders, money changers and anyone who needs to do currency conversions.
How to Use:

Next, enter the currency to convert to
Finally, enter the amount to convert.
The program will display the exchange rate along with the conversion result.
Enter “Y” to do another conversion or “N” to exit the program.
 
Technical Details:
4 critical and 1 auxiliary functions are defined for this application. The 4 critical functions are used to:
get the list of valid currency codes, 
get the exchange rates of a currency, 
get a valid currency code input from the user,
execute the main logic of the program. 
The auxiliary function is just for clearing the screen.
Sufficient error handling was implemented to anticipate invalid user inputs such as invalid currency codes and amounts and even entering other characters for the Y/N prompt. The program will also report a possible server or no internet connection issue.
Exhaustive comments have been added throughout the code to explain the purpose of the sections or lines of code. Additionally, variable and function names have been chosen to be descriptive to try to make the code easier to understand.
 
Future Plans:
GUI: Implement a graphical user interface to enhance a user’s overall experience.
Forex News Feeds: Show headlines related to forex.
Historical Data, Analytics and Forecasting: Allow users to view past exchange rates and analyze price movements. Offer an AI-assisted forecasting feature.
